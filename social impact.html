            <p>It is difficult to implement this idea using single speed breaker as people will get to know about it and they may not reduce the speed whenever they see it. Instead of using single speed breaker, it is better to use multiple speed breakers with some space in between, out of which, one or two will be made up of elastic material and rest of them will be normal speed breakers. This will also reduce the cost per unit of electricity and it will also help the village areas as a alternative source of electricity.
